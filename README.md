This repository contains a proof of concept implementation of a Windows service written in Go, demonstrating how to
create, install, and manage Windows services using Go's native capabilities.

## Background

Windows services are long-running applications that run in the background and don't interact with the user directly.
They're commonly used for tasks like monitoring, scheduling, or providing system-wide functionality. While creating
Windows services traditionally requires C++ or C#, Go provides excellent native support for Windows service
implementation.

## Motivation

Creating and managing Windows services often involves complex boilerplate code and system-specific knowledge. This
project aims to provide a clear, minimal implementation that demonstrates:

- How to implement a basic Windows service in Go
- Service installation and management
- Proper handling of Windows service lifecycle events
- Basic logging and configuration

## Current Features

- Basic Windows service implementation
- Service installation and uninstallation
- Start/Stop/Pause functionality
- Basic logging setup
- Configuration file support

## What is Missing for Production Use

- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit and integration tests
- Detailed logging and monitoring
- Configuration validation
- Recovery mechanisms
- Security hardening
- Documentation for deployment
- CI/CD pipeline setup

## Requirements

### Development

- Go 1.24 or higher
- Windows OS (for development and testing)
- Administrative privileges (for service installation)

### Build

- Go build tools
- Windows SDK (optional, for native Windows API access)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Build the Service**
   ```bash
   make build-binary
   ```

2. **Install the Service**
   ```bash
   make register-service
   ```

3. Manage the service in `Windows Services`
4. View logs in `Event Viewer`
